# Gemini Project: Book Search

This document outlines the development of a web application for searching books, as specified by the user.

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a small web app that lets users search for books. The application will feature a user-friendly interface for searching and browsing book results.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Vue.js, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript
*   **Backend**: Node.js (for a server-side orchestration layer)
*   **API**: Goodreads Public API

## Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with Vue.js. It will consist of:

*   A search bar for users to enter their search queries.
*   A results view to display the books retrieved from the backend.
*   UI components to handle pagination, loading states, and error messages.

### Backend

The backend will be a Node.js server that acts as a proxy and transformation layer between the frontend and the Goodreads API. Its responsibilities include:

*   Providing a RESTful API endpoint that accepts search queries and pagination parameters.
*   Fetching data from the Goodreads public API.
*   Transforming the XML response from the Goodreads API into a more frontend-friendly JSON format.
*   Sending the transformed JSON data back to the frontend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and a package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
*   A Goodreads API key

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Goodreads API key.
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers, allowing you to view the application in your browser.
