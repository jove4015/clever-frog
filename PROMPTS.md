# Project Prompts

This file contains a log of the prompts provided by the user to the Gemini CLI.

- Let's start off by generating a GEMINI.md for this project.  Here was the original spec for the project provided to us:   Create a small web app that lets users search for books. Use Vue/CSS/JS and a server-side orchestration layer in Node.js that proxies and transforms  the Goodreads public API. The front end should provide a search bar where a user can enter text, and view that shows book results. The backend should contain an endpoint that accepts search and pagination info, connects to the Goodreads search API, transforms the XML into JSON and keeps RESTful practices in mind. It's up to you what metadata you'd like to render for each book, how you want to handle display states for pagination, errors, etc.
- Let's use the .env file to hold our API key, using dotenv to load the env file in the server.js.
- I'm running the server locally and the initial UI looks right.  However, search requests to the backend are failing due to a CORS error.
- Is there any standardized way for you to keep track of the prompts I'm providing and store them along with the project?
- Yes.
- I would like for this project to be as typesafe as possible.  In the server.js, can we use Zod to validate the converted XML payload and ensure that it matches our expectations?
- In server.js, hardcoding the path to .env as ../.env is not working.  Please remove the parameter and just call dotenv.config().
- I've updated the flow in server.js.  Now, the XML payload is validated immediately after conversion.  Also, I added some softer handling to prevent runtime errors if this portion of the payload isn't there for any reason.
- Here is a sample of the response that comes back from Goodreads, after it is converted from XML.  Can you please create a zod schema that reflects this object's shape and then update booksSchema in server.js to use this schema?

- Let's work on the user interface a bit.  When the app first loads, I would like for the search box to be perfectly centered on the screen.  Remove the "Book Search" heading and instead of "Search for books..." the placeholder should read "What would you like to search today?".  Once a search is executed and the results are displayed, the search bar should move to the upper left of the screen and the results should flow down from there.
- I messed up that placeholder.  it should actually read: "What would you like to read today?"
- Instead of a green search button, I would like to use an SVG icon button that's attached to the right edge of the input.  Here is the SVG to use:  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"/><circle cx="112" cy="112" r="80" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="16"/><line x1="168.57" y1="168.57" x2="224" y2="224" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="16"/></svg>
- In the zod parser, we assume that average_rating is always a string, but sometimes it's an object more like this: {"_":"0.0","$":{"type":"float"}}.  Please update the zod parser to allow for either version and then update the conversion code to pull out the rating from inside the object if the object version is provided.
- For me, the fonts are overall just too large.  Can we reduce the font size, using 1 em for the title text and 0.5em for the remaining text, with half the line spacing that we currently see?
