# Project Prompts

This file contains a log of the prompts provided by the user to the Gemini CLI.

- Let's start off by generating a GEMINI.md for this project.  Here was the original spec for the project provided to us:   Create a small web app that lets users search for books. Use Vue/CSS/JS and a server-side orchestration layer in Node.js that proxies and transforms  the Goodreads public API. The front end should provide a search bar where a user can enter text, and view that shows book results. The backend should contain an endpoint that accepts search and pagination info, connects to the Goodreads search API, transforms the XML into JSON and keeps RESTful practices in mind. It's up to you what metadata you'd like to render for each book, how you want to handle display states for pagination, errors, etc.
- Let's use the .env file to hold our API key, using dotenv to load the env file in the server.js.
- I'm running the server locally and the initial UI looks right.  However, search requests to the backend are failing due to a CORS error.
- Is there any standardized way for you to keep track of the prompts I'm providing and store them along with the project?
- Yes.
- I would like for this project to be as typesafe as possible.  In the server.js, can we use Zod to validate the converted XML payload and ensure that it matches our expectations?
- In server.js, hardcoding the path to .env as ../.env is not working.  Please remove the parameter and just call dotenv.config().
- I've updated the flow in server.js.  Now, the XML payload is validated immediately after conversion.  Also, I added some softer handling to prevent runtime errors if this portion of the payload isn't there for any reason.
- Here is a sample of the response that comes back from Goodreads, after it is converted from XML.  Can you please create a zod schema that reflects this object's shape and then update booksSchema in server.js to use this schema?

- Let's work on the user interface a bit.  When the app first loads, I would like for the search box to be perfectly centered on the screen.  Remove the "Book Search" heading and instead of "Search for books..." the placeholder should read "What would you like to search today?".  Once a search is executed and the results are displayed, the search bar should move to the upper left of the screen and the results should flow down from there.
- I messed up that placeholder.  it should actually read: "What would you like to read today?"
- Instead of a green search button, I would like to use an SVG icon button that's attached to the right edge of the input.  Here is the SVG to use:  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"/><circle cx="112" cy="112" r="80" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="16"/><line x1="168.57" y1="168.57" x2="224" y2="224" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="16"/></svg>
- In the zod parser, we assume that average_rating is always a string, but sometimes it's an object more like this: {"_":"0.0","$":{"type":"float"}}.  Please update the zod parser to allow for either version and then update the conversion code to pull out the rating from inside the object if the object version is provided.
- For me, the fonts are overall just too large.  Can we reduce the font size, using 1 em for the title text and 0.5em for the remaining text, with half the line spacing that we currently see?
- Let's align the text so that it's always flush with the top of the book's image.  Also, can we update it to hide the "Published in...." if a publish year is not provided?
- Great!  For our next trick, we need to add pagination to our app.  Once a user executes a search and the search bar moves to the top left, you should see pagination buttons on the top right.  You should see a Back and Next button.  If you're on the first page, the Back button should be hidden.  If you're on the last page of results, the Next button should be hidden.
- Now let's use icon buttons instead of those green buttons for the pagination.  Here is the SVG for the back button: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"/><polyline points="160 208 80 128 160 48" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="16"/></svg>.  Here is the SVG for the next button:  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"/><polyline points="160 208 80 128 160 48" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="16"/></svg>
- Now I'd like to add more context to the pagination.  Between the back and next button, I want to add text (always displayed) that says Page X of Y, where X is the current page and Y is the total number of pages.
- OK.  We are looking good.  Now when someone enters a bad search that returns no results, the UI doesn't respond well.  I'd like to add handling to show a friendly error message like "No books were found, please try a different search!".  In this case, the pagination should not appear and the search bar should stay centered on screen waiting for the next search request.
- Now, here's one more fun edge case.  If the goodreads API returns exactly one book, this fails right now, because instead of an array, results.work contains just one goodreadsWorkSchema object.  Can we add handling for this third possibility?  Also - before you make your changes, I've already added handling for yet another case, which is where results is just a string (this is when no results at all are returned).  Please also preserve that handling that I've already added.
- Great.  As one last bit of finesse, I'd like to show progress while a network request is in progress.  Right now, when you execute a new search or go to the next page, it clears out the existing books immediately and then leaves the page blank briefly before the next results come back.  Instead of doing that, I would like to leave the current results displayed until new results are ready to be displayed - only hiding the results if no results come back in the new request.  I would also like to have a spinner displayed either (a) to the right of the search box, or (b) on the top right of the screen, if hasResults is true.
